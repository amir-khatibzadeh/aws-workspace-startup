# aws-workspace-startup
I wanted to start AWS workspace with specific profile name

the script can be exeuted with passing the name assigned to a saved profile in the AWS Workspace windows client 3+.

## Execution
***
```
powershell -File <PATH>\aws-workspace.ps1 -ProfileName <PROFILE_NAME>
```
Note: To use the script for the specific profile replace ```<PROFILE_NAME>``` with the profile name you saved in the profile list.
